we use `systemctl` to interact with `systemd`.

## Basic Operations:
### Boot-time loading

```
	systemctl enable ssh
	systemctl disable ssh

	systemctl enable --now ssh
	# --now -> runs a service immediately
```

**Note:** `.deb` and `.rpm` files will create their respective software's service automatically.

### Service Status

```
	sustemctl status apache2
```

### Temporarily start/stop

```
	systemctl start/stop apache2
```


### Custom Services

we put our service in this directory.
```
	/etc/systemd/system
```
**Note:** the name of the service file should be in this format: `name_of_service.service`.

the basic content of a service should be like this:
```
	[Unit]
	Description=Custom Service
	After=network.target
	[Service]
	User=example_user
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/customservie
	Execstart=/opt/customserve/service_binary
	Restart=always
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
- You can read about these options in this [Link](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/)
- the original reference is in this [Link](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html#Type=)

after writing the service's code then we should reload all the services and then just enabling the service.

```
	systemctl daemon-reload
	systemctl enable custome_service.service
```
