## How services in linux are managed?

`init` system -> The first service 
There are multiple `init` systems. Three in general:
- `sysvinit`
- `sysvinit`(Upstart version)
- `systemd` -> Most major distros use - handles services in a different way than other `init` systems
	- `systemctl` -> `systemd` utility 
----
- Both versions of `sysV` (upstart and the first version) are the same but the Upstart version of 
		`SysV` has made some improvements.

## How to know which `init` system we use?

#### 1st way (Hard Way)
Most of the times, the first processes after boot is `init` system, so that it handles all the services.

```
	ps aux | less
	# Output:
	root           1  0.0  0.0  23340 14096 ?        Ss   20:12   0:02 /sbin/init splash
```

if we look into `/sbin`  we find out it is a symlink to another directory.

```
	ls -l /
	# Output:
	... sbin -> usr/sbin
```

if we follow the symlink we get to the `/usr/sbin`. the `init` 
```
	cd /usr/sbin
	ls -l | grep "init"
	# Output:
	init -> ../lib/systemd/systemd
```

so it is another symlink to `/usr/lib/systemd/systemd` script. we can conclude that
we are using `systemd` `init` system.

#### 2nd way (Easy way)
You can just read the manual page of the `init` system.
```
	man init
```
