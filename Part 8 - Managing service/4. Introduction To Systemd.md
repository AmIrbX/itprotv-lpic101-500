## What are `systemd`'s features?
- More reliable
- Faster (does parallel processing)

## How to know if i'm using `systemd`?
As you know the first process after booting is the `init` system.
so we should just check the first process and follow that trail.

```
	ps aux
```

- Sometimes it can be just a symlink
- Sometimes it directly says that i'm using `systemd`

**If it's a symlink, just follow the link**

## Where are the configuration files?
After loading all the necessary binaries `systemd`'s config files will
be loaded.

```
	/lib/systemd/system # Will be overwritten after upgrades
	/etc/systemd/system # Best place for our custom changes
```

## Is there a thing the same as `run levels` in `systemd`?
Yes and it is called `target`.

```
	/lib/systemd/system
		runlevel0.target -> poweroff.target
		runlevel1.target -> rescue.target
		runlevel2.target -> multi-user.target
		runlevel3.target -> multi-user.target
		runlevel4.target -> multi-user.target
		runlevel5.target -> graphical.target
		runlevel6.target -> reboot.target
```
For compatibility reasons they have created symlinks to the `target` files 
so that older scripts and programs wouldn't have a problem in running.

### What `target` am i using?

```
	systemctl get-default
```


### How to change my default `target`?

```
	sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```
 After reboot you will find that you can't access the network.



### How to change the `target` but without rebooting?

```
	sudo systemctl isolate target.file
```
