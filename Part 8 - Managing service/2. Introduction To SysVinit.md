## How to configure its settings?

```
	/etc/rc.d
		rc.local # you can customize SysV with this file
		rc.sysinit # DON'T CHANGE ITS CONTENT
```

- `rc.sysinit` after system updates can be overwritten so if you change it 
	you may lose your changes
- but `rc.local` will not get overwritten after an upgrade and recommended
	for changes.
	- it will run after all `init` scripts.

## How `SysV` manage  the states of the computer?
A  computer can have different states such as `reboot`, `shutdown`,`turn on` and 
other states. In `SysV` these states are  called `Run Levels`.
They specify the state of our system and **can be different in every distro**.
`Run levels` have numbers starting from `0` to `6`.

in Cent-OS 6 they mean:
- `0` -> Shutdown state
- `1` -> Single User Mode (All network utilities will be disabled and only one user can login Locally)
- `2`-> Multi-User Mode (multiple users can only login locally and they can't access to the network)
- `3`->   Full Multi-User Mode (Without any limitations and will boot without a GUI)
- `4` -> Unused (Custom Boot)
- `5`-> XII or ... (Boots with a GUI)
- `6` -> Reboot state

### Which `run level` am i using?

```
	runlevel
	# Output:
	N   5
```

- `N`-> No change since boot
- `5` -> Boot with GUI

```
	who -r
	run-level 5  2024-05-29 21:06
```


### How to change `run level`?

#### Editing `/etc/inittab` (Needs reboot)

#### Using commands(Without reboot)
```
	# 1st Way:
	sudo init runlevel
	sudo init 3	

	# 2nd Way:
	sudo telinit runlevel
	sudo telinit 3
```
