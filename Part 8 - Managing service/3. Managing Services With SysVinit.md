We use `chkconfig` for interacting with `SysV`.

```
	chkconfig httpd on/off
```

- `httpd` -> a service
- `on/off`-> the state that you want the service have
	- `on`-> Starts the service in boot-time
	- `off`-> Disables boot-time loading

```
	service httpd status
	service httpd start # Starts the service immediately
	service httpd stop # Stops the service immediately
	service httpd restart
```

##### Running services in certain `run levels`
```
	chkconfig --list # All services + run levels status
	chkconfig --level 35 httpd on
```
- `35`-> 2 run levels `3`+`5`
- `httpd`-> the service
- `on/off`-> the state we want the service have
