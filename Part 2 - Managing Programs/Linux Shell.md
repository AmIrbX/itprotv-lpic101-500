## Differences between Terminal and Shell?
Shell -> actual command emulator that runs commands
Terminal -> UI and the software


---

Cmd:
```
	which CMD  # Shows the path of the binary that CMD is running
```
```
	history # Shows all commands executed after booting
```

Commands -> have default behaviors
			but with arguments we change their behaviors
			e.g:
```
	uname # Output: Linux
	uname -a  # Output: Linux Username Kernel_Version #26~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP
   		            # PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Date/Time UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

```
	ps # Shows the processes for the running shell
	ps aux # Shows all processes (a) from all users (u) and golobally (x)	
```

## View Text Files
```
	less filename.extension # recommended for long files - allows for scrolling
					# up and down and searching

	more filename.extension # like less command but only allows scrolling down

	gedit filename.extension # A GUI for viewing and editing files
```
