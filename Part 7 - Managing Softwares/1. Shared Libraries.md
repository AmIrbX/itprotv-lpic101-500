## What are shared libraries?

They are pieces of code that we may want to use in our program.

## Where are shared libraries located?

| Boot system libraries:         |               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `/lib`                         | `/usr/lib`    |
| Shared Libraries for 32/64 bit |               |
| `/lib32`                       | `/usr/lib32`  |
| `/lib64`                       | `/usr/lib64`  |
| `/libx32`                      | `/usr/libx32` |
**All of these direcories are in fact just a symlink.


### Shared libraries name format

```
	ls -lh /usr/lib64:
		# name.so.version.number
		ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
	
```
- This is the short name


```
	ls -lh /usr/lib
		ibsidplay2.so.1 -> libsidplay2.so.1.0.1
```
- This is the full name + full version number




## How to catalog all shared libraries?

`ld` is a shared library responsible for this job.

```
	ldconfig -v
```

`ldconfig` searches through the folders that were specified in its own configuration
folder.


### Where are the config files of `ld`?

```
	/etc/ld.so.conf.d
```

## What libraries a program use?
We can use `ldd` to determine a program's dependencies (Libraries).
`ldd` -> Library Daemon Dependencies

```
	ldd /bin/bash
	ldd /binary/file/location
```


## How to install libraries?
There are a lot of directories to put our binary/shared library in but we may forget where we 
put them because there are actually a lot of paths that we will have to look into them. so the most
common place to put our shared folder is:
```
	~/.local/
		lib/ # Libraries
		bin/ # Binaries
		share/ # Programs's Data 
```

But the downfall is that `ldconfig` doesn't know about this place so you should add it in 
its config files.

```
	# 1st Way
	sudo ldconfig -n ~/.local/lib

	# 2nd Way
	cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d
	nano custome_libraries
		# Add the custom libraries path
		/home/ruinedrome/.local/lib
```
