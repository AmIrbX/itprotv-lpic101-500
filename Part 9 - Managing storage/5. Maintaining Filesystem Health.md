## What can damage a storage device's health?
- Physical Impact (Mostly Unrecoverable)
- Too many Read-Write operations over time (Fixable)
- Power Outages that may cause data corruptions

Most of the times the kernel checks the integrity of file systems before booting so that there isn't a problem
with it and if there's something wrong with it then the boot process will fail.
the partitions and their file systems are located in `/etc/fstab`. if  there's something wrong then we should
check this file.

there is one thing we care about in this context (Maintaining Filesystem Health)about `/etc/fstab/`: 
```
	cat /etc/fstab
	# <file system>             <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
```

- `<pass>` :It is for checking the file system 
	- `0` -> Do not check
	- `1` -> Check and if failed don't boot (High priority)
	- `2` -> Check but if failed still boot (Low priority)

## How to run a filesystem check without rebooting?
We can use `fsck` but there's a limitation and that is the partition we are checking should be unmounted.
```
	sudo fsck /dev/sdb1
```
-  `-A` -> Check all disks
- `-t` -> Filesystem type(`ext3`,`xfs`, ...)

**It's best to use the tool specifically developed for checking a certain filesystem in some distros**
**`xfs` in Red Hat**
```
	sudo xfs_repair -L /dev/nvme0n2p1
```
