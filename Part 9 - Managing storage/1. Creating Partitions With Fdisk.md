## Partitions
There are two common partition.
- MBR -> Master Boot Record
- GPT ->  GUID Partition Table
### MBR
- One of the oldest partition layouts
- Most compatible 
- Limited Primary Partitions

### GPT
- Volumes instead of partitions
- More storage capacity
- Newer technology
- More partitions (128)

**Virtual machines and some old server may use MBR partition**

## How to Create MBR partition with `fdisk`?

Each partition has its own utility (`fdisk`and `gdisk`).
**First list all the disks and their location with `lsblk`**
```
	lsblk
```

For modifying MBR partitions we can use `fdisk`
```
	sudo fdisk  /dev/sdX

	sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Some of `fdisk` commands:
- `p` -> Print Current Partitions
- `n` -> Create New Partitions
- `w` -> Write The Partitions (Save Layout)
- `d` -> Deletes the partition


```
	sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
		> n
		> Primary or Extended (p or e): p
		> Partition Number(1-4): 1
		> First Sector (Default:2048): 
		> Last Sector: +100G
```

- `Primary or Extended` : 
	- `Primary` : A primary partition is in which an Operating System can be installed.
	- `Extended` : In an Extended Partition you can create unlimited logical drives. You can store data in the logical partitions similar with primary partition 
- `Partition Number(1-4)` : In MBR you can only create 4 primary partition and the number starts with 1 not 0.
- `First Sector (Default:2048)` : The first `2048` sector is reserved for [MBR partition table][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record]. you should leave it as it is.
- `Last Sector ...` : The size of your partition based on the sectors or storage capacity.
	- `+/- (K,M,G,T,P)` : Size Based
		- `+20K`->  20 Kilo Bytes
		- `+20M`-> 20 Mega Bytes
		- `+20G`-> 20 Giga Bytes
	- `+/- sectors` : Sectors Based

\*`fdisk`**doesn't support GPT partitions**.





## How to Create GPT partition with `gdisk`?
`gdisk` is a tool for modifying GPT partitions. the syntax of `gdisk` and `fdisk` is not different.

```
	sudo gdisk /dev/sdX
```
- `p` -> Print Current Partitions
- `n` -> Create New Partitions
- `w` -> Write The Partitions (Save Layout)
- `d` -> Deletes the partition
