## How much free space each partition has?

```
	df -h
```
- `-h` -> Human Readable (Bytes to GB)
in this way we can see which partition has the least free space and investigate into it. But there's a problem 
and that we don't know which directories used up the most space. so we're gonna use `du`.

## How much space each directory occupy?
For example if we want to know which directories in the root `/` occupy the most space we can use:

```
	sudo du -chd 1 /
```
- `du` -> Disk utilization
- `-chd`
	- `c` -> Total used space
	- `h` -> Prints in a human readable
	- `d 1` -> Depth of scan (How deep `du` scans)


## How to monitor the disk performance in real time?

```
	sudo apt install iotop # Install iotop
	sudo iotop
```
