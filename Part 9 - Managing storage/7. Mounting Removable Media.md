There are 2 places that medias and devices that are connected to the system and mounted can be accessed.

```
	/mnt
	/media/$USER	
```

## How to unmount/mount ?

```
	sudo mount /dev/location /mount/location
	
	/mnt/ > sudo mkdir USB
	sudo mount /dev/sdc /mnt/USB


	sudo umount /mount/location
	sudo /mnt/USB
```

\* You should know the name of the device to mount it.


### How to know the name of the device  to mount it?

```
	lsblk 

	sudo dmesg -w
```

- `lsblk` -> Showing all partitions 
	- You can see which partition doesn't have a name and conclude that it's not mounted and it's the USB you want to mount
- `sudo dmesg -w` -> Real-time log file of connected devices
	- Enter this command and then connect your device and see what is its name


## Unmounting CD/DVD
Ejecting a CD/DVD is a bit different. First you have to unmount it and then eject it so that the CD/DVD in the optical CD drive literally 
ejects.

```
	sudo umount /mnt/cdrom
	eject
```

\* Be careful of putting the right input to the `umount`. it is recommended to use the mounted point to eject the device whether it
is a USB or CD.
