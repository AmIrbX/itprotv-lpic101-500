## How to use it?

```
	sudo parted
		> print devices # Shows all Storage Devices
		> print free # Lists all partitions + free size
		> print all # Lists all devices and partitions		
```

### Create a partition:
- Select the storage device
```
	select /dev/sda
```

- If the device doesn't have a partition table, first you should create one.
```
	mklabel 
		> gpt/mbr
```

- Now we can create the partition.
```
	# 1
	mkpart
		> gpt
		> ext4
		First Sector > 1
		Last Sector > 1000

	# 2	
	mkpart gpt ext4 1 1000
```


### Remove a partition:
- Select the storage device
```
	select /dev/sda
```

- Remove a partition with `rm` with its number 
```
	rm 4 # Remove partition 4
```
